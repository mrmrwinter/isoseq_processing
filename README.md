# IsoSeq Processing
## A snakemake workflow to automate the IsoSeq3 pipeline from Pacific Biosciences

The workflow currently requires as input the `flnc.bam` file from the postprocessing stage of IsoSeq sequencing, and a genome assembly.

First, clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mrmrwinter/isoseq_processing.git`

Next, navigate to the `isoseq_processing` directory and set up the paths in the `config.yaml` file.
